# Koncept3
## Koncept3. Connect your brand with me!

Welcome to Koncept3! This repository contains the code and resources for developing the Koncept3 decentralized application (dApp). The dApp aims to connect brands with their audience in innovative ways. By following the steps outlined in the branches of this repository, you can contribute to the development of Koncept3.

## Branches
The repository has several branches that represent different steps in the development process. Each branch focuses on a specific aspect of the dApp and provides instructions on how to contribute effectively. Here is an overview of the available branches:

1. [Step-01-Project-Setup](../../Step-01-Project-Setup): This branch covers the initial setup process. It includes instructions for installing the necessary dependencies, setting up the development environment, and configuring the project structure. 

2. [Step-02-UI-Design](../../Step-02-UI-Design): This branch focuses on the user interface (UI) design of Koncept3. It provides guidelines, design assets, and code samples for creating an intuitive and visually appealing user experience. 

3. [Step-03-Smart-Contract-Development](../../Step-03-Smart-Contract-Development): In this branch, you will find the smart contract code for Koncept3. It defines the core functionality and logic of the dApp on the blockchain. Instructions for testing and deploying the smart contract are also provided. 

4. [Step-04-Wallet-Connect](../../Step-04-Wallet-Connect): In this branch, you will learn how to connect your wallet with the Koncept3 dApp. Connecting a wallet is essential for interacting with the blockchain and performing transactions securely. You will explore different wallet providers, such as MetaMask or WalletConnect, and learn how to integrate them into the dApp's frontend. Instructions and code samples will be provided to handle wallet connection events, retrieve account information, and interact with the smart contracts using the connected wallet. 

5. [Step-05-Frontend-NFT-Development](../../Step-05-Frontend-NFT-Development): In this branch, you will integrate the NFT (Non-Fungible Token) and NFT Marketplace Smart Contracts into the frontend of the Koncept3 dApp. These smart contracts enable users to buy and sell unique digital assets, such as artwork or collectibles, as NFTs on the blockchain. 

6. [Step-06-Frontend-Event-Development](../../Step-06-Frontend-Event-Development): In this step, you will enhance the Koncept3 dApp by integrating the Event Smart Contract into the frontend. This integration will enable users to participate in events created by the brand and earn rewards for their participation. 

7. [Step-07-The-Graph-Protocol](../../Step-07-The-Graph-Protocol): In this step, you will integrate The Graph protocol into the Koncept3 dApp and create a subgraph to provide a more scalable and flexible API for reading data from and writing data to the Smart Contract. 

Please note that these branches are meant to be followed sequentially, as each step builds upon the previous one. Make sure to read the instructions and guidelines in each branch carefully before proceeding.
